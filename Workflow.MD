Lower Level - C/ C+/ C++ Ect.
    - This can be translated easily to binary, very similar to the punchcards of old.
    - these are easier to correlate to actual binary language, however take a lot more effort to code complex problems

Higher Level - Python, Java, C#, Javascript, Ect.
    - Coded in english
    - can be compiled or interpreted
    - much easier to code complex problems
    - harder to locate and fix bugs (they have a lot more under the hood)

primitive data types 
- int
- char/character
- floats
- double
- string
- boolean

complex data types
- array
- object
- hash map
- tuple
- dict(python)

memory usage
charA = a
charB = t
    in order to make the word 'at'
    I need to reference both memory locations in order
    ie:  charA + charB
    I can create a new memory location by adding them and assiging it to a variable
    ie: VAR X = charA + charB
    Print VAR X will result in at
    VAR X has it's own memory location independant of charA and charB
    if I reassign charA after VAR X is still at
